# Hello World. It's me, Jim.

I'm Jim Leahy. I've worked for over a decade in software support, implementation, and project 
management for a pediatrics-focused EHR company. For a few years now, my role has shifted to
senior application support and lite development.

I'm currently studying part-time at Champlain College to become a web developer. I enjoy 
spending my days solving complex problems and building solutions that allow people to do 
more of what they enjoy and less of what they don't. 

Outside of work and school, I enjoy the outdoors and cooking with my wife and son. Food
has always been a passion of mine, and I love big event-style cooking as much as I do
working toward the perfect pizza.
